moteus-c1 is a small form factor controller with the flexibility of
the moteus-n1, but designed for lower power and current applications.

# TODO #

 * mark tabs in factory layer?

 * final DRC

r1.1 MAYBE
 * possible remove all the gate drive resistors and protection diodes?
 * maybe lower max voltage to 51V and drop the TVS diode by one step
